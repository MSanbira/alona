            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p className="text-with-margin">
              Pendo Heartbeat was first created as a component library 3 years
              ago when the company first moved to Figma. At the time there were
              ~5 designers on the team across 2 global hubs. 3 years later, the
              team had grown to 16 designers across 5 different time zones, with
              a forecast of doubling by the end of 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              The engineering team had also grown significantly in that time,
              along with a growing portfolio of products from different
              acquisitions over the years. Near the end of 2020, I felt like
              things needed to change. The library wasnâ€™t enough, and with the
              massive scaling we were experiencing as a company, we needed
              something more robust to support our growing teams.
